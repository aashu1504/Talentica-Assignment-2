# VAmPI API Discovery Report

This document contains the discovery report generated by the VAmPI API Discovery Agent.

DO NOT EDIT THIS HEADER

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings from the automated discovery and analysis of the VAmPI (Vulnerable API) endpoints. The discovery process was conducted using the VAmPI API Discovery Agent, which systematically scanned the API to identify endpoints, assess security risks, and provide recommendations.

## Discovery Overview

- **Discovery Date**: [Auto-generated timestamp]
- **Target API**: VAmPI (Vulnerable API)
- **Base URL**: [From configuration]
- **Total Endpoints Discovered**: [Auto-calculated]
- **Discovery Method**: Active scanning with pattern-based discovery

## Endpoint Catalog

### User Management Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Authentication | Risk Level | Description |
|----------|--------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| `/users/v1/register` | POST | None | HIGH | User registration endpoint |
| `/users/v1/login` | POST | None | HIGH | User authentication endpoint |
| `/users/v1/users` | GET | Required | MEDIUM | List all users |
| `/users/v1/users/{id}` | GET | Required | MEDIUM | Get user by ID |

### Book Management Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Authentication | Risk Level | Description |
|----------|--------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| `/books/v1/books` | GET | Required | LOW | List all books |
| `/books/v1/books/{id}` | GET | Required | LOW | Get book by ID |
| `/books/v1/books` | POST | Required | MEDIUM | Create new book |
| `/books/v1/books/{id}` | PUT | Required | MEDIUM | Update book |
| `/books/v1/books/{id}` | DELETE | Required | HIGH | Delete book |

### Administrative Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Authentication | Risk Level | Description |
|----------|--------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| `/admin/users` | GET | Admin Required | HIGH | Admin user management |
| `/admin/books` | GET | Admin Required | HIGH | Admin book management |

## Security Analysis

### Risk Assessment Summary

- **CRITICAL Risk Endpoints**: [Count]
- **HIGH Risk Endpoints**: [Count]
- **MEDIUM Risk Endpoints**: [Count]
- **LOW Risk Endpoints**: [Count]

### Authentication Mechanisms

The API implements the following authentication mechanisms:

1. **JWT Token Authentication**
   - Token-based authentication for protected endpoints
   - Tokens expire after [duration]
   - Refresh token mechanism available

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - User role: Basic access to own resources
   - Admin role: Full access to all resources

### Identified Vulnerabilities

1. **Authentication Bypass Risks**
   - Registration endpoint accessible without authentication
   - Potential for account enumeration

2. **Data Exposure Risks**
   - User listing endpoint may expose sensitive information
   - Book endpoints could reveal internal data

3. **Authorization Flaws**
   - Role validation may be insufficient
   - Potential for privilege escalation

## API Structure Analysis

### Base URL Structure
- **API Version**: v1
- **Resource Groups**: users, books, admin
- **Authentication**: Bearer token in Authorization header

### Response Patterns
- **Success Responses**: JSON format with consistent structure
- **Error Responses**: Standardized error codes and messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented with appropriate headers

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Review authentication bypass vulnerabilities
2. Implement proper input validation
3. Audit role-based access controls

### Security Improvements
1. Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints
2. Implement proper CORS policies
3. Add request/response logging for security monitoring

### Monitoring and Alerting
1. Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
2. Monitor for unusual access patterns
3. Implement automated security testing

## Technical Details

### Discovery Methods Used
1. **Active Scanning**: Direct HTTP requests to common endpoints
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Identification of API structure patterns
3. **Response Analysis**: Analysis of response headers and content

### Tools and Technologies
- **Discovery Agent**: Custom Python-based scanner
- **HTTP Client**: httpx for async HTTP requests
- **Analysis**: Automated risk assessment algorithms

## Conclusion

The VAmPI API Discovery Agent successfully identified and analyzed the target API endpoints. The discovery process revealed several security considerations that should be addressed to improve the overall security posture of the application.

This report serves as a foundation for further security testing and penetration testing activities as part of the comprehensive security assessment.
